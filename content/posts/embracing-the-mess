I used to organize my life like a bento box.

I'd follow strict schedules on my calendar, keep a spotless household. Everything had its place.

Things changed when I met Bianca. The woman I'd eventually marry lived freely, unbound by rigid routine.

The best examples I can think of involve our travels. When things wouldn't go as planned, my initial reaction would be disappointment, but hers was excitement. It was just another opportunity to experience something new.

Things changed again when we had our son. 

Having a child is messy. Food gets on their clothes or thrown on the floor. Toys are often scattered on the floor. All are signs of a child growing and learning. 

These two have taught me so much. That some of the best things in life are messy.
