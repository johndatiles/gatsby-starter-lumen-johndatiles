I spend a lot of time thinking about writing. And yet all that time spent has produced very little here. Writing publicly is difficult.

Writing privately is easier. I can be as messy as I want. Drafts and journal entries are often a stream of conciousness. There’s no editing, no spellcheck. No pressure when I know I won’t be publishing something.

So what’s the point of me writing online?

I often feel I need to have something profound to say or share. I get stuck on whether I feel like a piece of writing is worthy of putting on this site.

In the end I think the point is to try and be a better writer. Just the potential that this might be seen by someone else makes me feel like I need to be clearer in whatever it is I’m trying to say.

As I write this, I see a slew of notes in my sidebar. Half-baked ideas I haven’t developed.

Those notes will continue to sit in purgatory unless I work at it. If my goal is to be a better writer, I better practice. Got to start somewhere.

Writing is a muscle.
