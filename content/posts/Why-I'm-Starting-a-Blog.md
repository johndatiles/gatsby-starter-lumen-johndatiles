## 1. Improve My Writing

Think of the ways you write. You probably do at least one of the following every day: email, text, DM, or comment on social media. These days, I'm writing a lot more emails as I'm (lucky to be) working from home.

In writing emails, there are times after I press send where I ask myself, "did that make sense?" or think, "that was too wordy." I'm able to improve on that writing because I'm doing it every day.

But what about longer-form writing outside of emails, outside of social media? I have a daily journal, but the only reader for that is future-me.
By writing openly on the internet, there's now a reader on the other side other than myself. If I'm being honest, the only person who'll probably be reading this is my wife Bianca (with a sprinkle of some family and friends.) But writing outside of my closed bubble, I'm at least aware that now I'm conveying ideas to someone other than myself. And that forces me to be more thoughtful in my writing.

The main reason for starting this blog is to practice long-form writing—practice, practice, and practice some more.

## 2. Stretch My Creative Muscle

Writing is a creative process. 

Presenting ideas I want to expand on requires imagination. 

Creating something tangible out of my thoughts requires invention. 

Writing about a myriad of topics gives me the freedom to experiment and play with words.

## 3. Learn to Code

When I was younger, my brother and I would make websites for fun. We loved exploring the funky digital spaces of the internet's early days, full of text colors that hurt your eyes, visitor counters, and random gifs. Reminiscing on that reminded me of how *fun* it was.

Yes, there are services out there that create websites for you, but I'm enjoying understanding the code behind the website. I want to build this one from the ground up.

Creating websites back in the day gave me limited experience with HTML and CSS. I'm building on that by learning JavaScript and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/) to build a static website (meaning no fancy databases or content management systems).

At the time of this post, I'm using a tweaked version of the Gatsby Lumen Starter template. The plan is to build this anew as I learn more about coding with JavaScript.

## 4. Own My Content

Remember MySpace or AsianAvenue? I used to have accounts there, lost them, and lost everything I posted or wrote. It would've been fun to look back at those now. I imagine cringing at my 16- or 17-year-old self, but it'd still be fun to read.

Losing accounts is my fault, sure. To make sure I never lose these snippets of thought, I have this entire website backed up offline. No doubt I'll still share parts of my life on social media. But I don't know where platforms like Instagram or Facebook will be in 10 or 20 years. What might happen to that data?

I'm sure the internet will still be here, and this longer-form writing seems something worth keeping. I want to make sure I own it.

## 5. Step Outside My Comfort Zone
I'll be honest. Writing this to put out in the open is uncomfortable. 

Anything you do for the first time is. Learning to drive or your first job interview out of college. Riding your motorcycle on the freeway for the first time. Or presenting your project to local legislators. 

Those are uncomfortable situations. You grow from them. It's healthy to step outside your comfort zone.

## 6. Share Ideas
Part of the reason to write publicly is to share my ideas. 

The internet is a vast ocean. There's no way to read, watch, learn, know everything. From my little dips in this digital ocean, I've come away with ideas and thoughts to share. I'll write about the ones that resonate with me—writing to expand my mind and sharpen my thinking.

I hope you find some value here in my small corner of the internet.

## 7. Document My Life
The posts I write here are really notes to myself. For future-me to read the thoughts of past-me and reflect. It'll be interesting to see how my writing evolves (or devolves), what the website will look like, and how much I've grown (hopefully).

Writing is like telepathy. As a reader, you're transported into the mind of the writer. 

Hello future-me. What do you think so far?

Those were seven reasons of why I'm starting a blog. The inspiration though came from Bianca, my wife. She has a blog where she writes about our IVF journey (read it at [ifmypunanicouldtalk.com](https://ifmypunanicouldtalk.com/)). Seeing her write and finding joy in the process inspired me to start my own.
