In past years when I've set resolutions and goals, I'd make detailed plans and structure my days very specifically.

Being a new father changes things. My priority is to help with the caretaking responsibilities as much as possible. It's challenging to block off specific times of the day to dedicate to writing or exercise as I want to be as flexible as possible to the needs of my family.

So I'm aiming to keep things simple: open a book, write a few sentences, get outside, sit at the piano. If these lead to longer sessions, great. If not, still great. I made an effort to commit to the habit. No strict goals like reading X amount of books this year or rigid routines like writing for 30 minutes at 6am each day.

I'm reminded of a couple habit-building techniques from the book [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292). Highly recommended.

- Build identity-based habits: the goal is not necessarily to write a book but to become a person who writes every day.
- The Two-Minute Rule: starting a habit should take less than two minutes to do. In my case, I can open a book each day and read for two minutes (likely leading to longer sessions).

Keeping it simple makes it easy to engage in these habits every day. And these daily habits reinforce the identity I want to build.

What about habits for being a good husband and father? What small things can I do each day to become the best I can be?

A few ideas: asking how I can help, not rushing through bedtime, expressing gratitude. Continuing to think of ways I can be better in this role as a parent.

Keeping it simple, keeping it focused.
