### About Me
I was raised in the Bay Area, graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Civil Engineering, then worked 7 years for Caltrans. 

During that time, I met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Oahu. I've since found meaningful work as a Civil Engineer for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources ([DLNR](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/)).

I'm a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), registered in both California and Hawaii.

This website is a way for me to practice writing, learn code, share ideas, and document my life. More on that in my first blog post [here](posts/why-im-starting-a-blog).

Feel free to reach out to me [@johndatiles](https://twitter.com/johndatiles) on Twitter.

### What I'm Doing Now
[Nesting](https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-health-wellness/nesting-during-pregnancy-5364/) with my wife, Bianca.

Managing design projects for construction in Hawaii for the DLNR. My most recently completed project was [Waikiki Beach Maintenance 2](https://vimeo.com/519295137), where 20,000 cubic yards of sand was pumped from off-shore to renourish the beach.

Learning to code with JavaScript and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/) to rebuild this website and restart my blog. This site currently uses the Gatsby Lumen Starter that I slightly customized.

Reading [*Like A Mother*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068708-like-a-mother) by Angela Garbes. Intimate thoughts and questions of the science and culture surrounding pregnancy from a first-time mother.
