### About Me

I was raised in the Bay Area and worked a while for Caltrans. I then met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Hawaii. 

I currently work as a Project Engineer for the Department of Land and Natural Resources ([DLNR](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/)), managing design projects for construction in Hawaii.
### What I'm Doing Now

Learning to code with JavaScript and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/) to rebuild this website and restart my blog. This is work in progress! Currently this site uses the Gatsby Lumen Starter that I tweaked.

Reading [*Mastering the Craft of Writing*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22138137-mastering-the-craft-of-writing) by Stephen Wilbers. More on why I want to improve my writing in my first blog post [here](posts/why-im-starting-a-blog).

Navigating IVF with my wife, Bianca, who writes about our journey on her [blog](https://ifmypunanicouldtalk.com/).
