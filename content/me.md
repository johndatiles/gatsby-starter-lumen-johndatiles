### About Me
I was raised in the Bay Area, graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Civil Engineering, then worked 7 years for Caltrans. 

During that time, I met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Oahu. After the birth of our child, we moved to Maui, where I now work for the county.

I'm a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), registered in both California and Hawaii.

This website is a way for me to practice writing, learn code, and share ideas.

Feel free to reach out to me [@johndatiles](https://twitter.com/johndatiles) on Twitter.

### What I'm Doing Now
Enjoying family life.

Getting back into a writing habit.
