### A Bit About Me

I was raised in the Bay Area and worked a while for Caltrans. I then met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Hawaii. 

I currently work as a Project Engineer for the Department of Land and Natural Resources [(DLNR)](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/), managing design projects for construction in Hawaii.
