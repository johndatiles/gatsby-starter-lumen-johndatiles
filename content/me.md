### About Me
I was raised in the Bay Area, graduated from UC Davis, then worked 7 years for Caltrans. 

I then met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Hawaii. 

I'm a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), registered in both California and Hawaii.

This website is a way for me to practice writing, learn code, share ideas, and document my life. More on that in my first blog post [here](posts/why-im-starting-a-blog).

Feel free to reach out to me [@johndatiles](https://twitter.com/johndatiles) on Twitter.

### What I'm Doing Now
Managing design projects for construction in Hawaii for the Department of Land and Natural Resources ([DLNR](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/)).

Learning to code with JavaScript and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/) to rebuild this website and restart my blog. This site currently uses the Gatsby Lumen Starter that I slightly customized.

Reading [*Mastering the Craft of Writing*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22138137-mastering-the-craft-of-writing) by Stephen Wilbers.

Navigating IVF with my wife, Bianca, who writes about our journey on her [blog](https://ifmypunanicouldtalk.com/).
